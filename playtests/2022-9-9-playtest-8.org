** Comments / Suggestions
*** Jordan
**** End game
- Target an 8 round game.
- Focus on ending the game when 1 person's colony dies.
- Define a more concrete colony death state
*** Nick
**** Building Adjustments
- Rather than having every advanced building built with adv. buildng material have advanced buildings instead require a matching adv. material of /their/ type.
- Give buildings varied point values rather than just 1 pt per size.
- Add scoring only buildings and theme those around recreation.
- Have more buildings that simply just give a resource.
**** Meeple / Class Adjustments
- Cut the Chef
- Blend Scientist and Scout
- Maybe cut medic
**** Population / Camp Management
- Consider requiring feeding / healing or population degrades
*** Josh
**** Building Adjustments
- Sentry gun needs to be better.
- Cut the map room and just adjust how new locations spawn.
- Ramp up the farm's production.

*** Tyler
**** Location Adjustment
- More swingy locations with fewer types.
- It's ok if the deck shuffles, these are not "named" locations.
- Make sure more types of adv. resources are spread out
**** Game Pace
- Ramp things up a little faster in zombie intensity.
- But ofc adjust killing capabilities to stay on par.
**** Research Tracks
- Rather than a handful of small basic research have a research track that will be more tied into the game.
  - Certain threshholds trigger building bonsues, special abilities etc.
