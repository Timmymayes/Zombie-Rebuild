| Jun 07 2020 | Prototype - Initial       | Component Types decided           | Ideation tool for expanding the design                                             |
| Nov 22 2020 | Prototype - Initial       | Intial Components built           | Locking in mechanisms & representing them                                          |
| Sep 05 2021 | Playtest - Local          | First 3p Playtest                 | Played with Jim & Sandra - Good feedback from both. Best idea. Multi-size building |
| Sep 12 2021 | Playtest - Solo           | 2-handed test                     | Dialing in multi-size buildings                                                    |
| Aug 23 2021 | Playtest - Local          | First 2p Test with Jordan         | Good feedback, requested more use of scientist / research.                         |
| Oct 15 2021 | Prototype - Development   | Building design Update            | multi-sized buildings look nice                                                    |
| Nov 29 2021 | Prototype - Development   | Added 3d Printed Components       | Implemented better components and solo playable                                    |
| Feb 10 2022 | Prototype - Development   | Full building set complete        | Game is now ready for solo playtesting                                             |
| Jun 12 2022 | Playtest - Local          | Second 2p Test with Jordan        | Good feedback on research points.                                                  |
| Sep 09 2022 | Playtest - Local          | First 4p Playtest                 | Played with Josh, Jordan and Nick. Lots of good feedback. Major Course correction  |
| Feb 17 2024 | Playtest - Tuesday Gfroup | Testing Nick's big rework         | Main issue was zombie track build up. It just becomes too transactional and large  |
| Feb 18 2024 | Playtest - Octoraffe      | 2p Test to tweak Zombie track Arc | Introduced an ARKHAM LCG bag mechanic for zombie tracker and it worked really well |
|             |                           |                                   |                                                                                    |

* V.02 -
** Played with Nick @ his place with new changes
*** Goal
- Increase the decision vectors on what you want to solve problems.
- Original version was too on rails
- Came up with lots of ways to survive little scoring
*** Change Log
**** Grid changes
- 3x3 instead of 2 by 2
  |          | Healthy | Sick | Critical |
  | Fed      |       2 |    1 |        1 |
  | Hungry   |       1 |    1 |        1 |
  | Starving |       1 |    1 |        1 |
- Ammo doubles fight value
- Only Healthy Fed can be allocated
**** Order of Operations
0. Allocate
1. Building
2. Rummage
3. Camp
4. Fight
5. Become Hungry
6. Return people at camp (to hungry)
7. Return people from rummage
8. Queue Zombies for next round
9. Increase Zombie track
**** Player board has a camp map and locations for allocating
***** This is used as a minimap for assigning your workers/actions
***** Recruit leader space as well (used 1x)
**** Leaders and Citizens get "meeples" with activation numbers for determining resolution order.
**** Location changes
- Distribution is more spikey
- Varied # of max depleted tokens for wiping
- each location gets varibale # of *citizens*, May be taken instead of drawing tokens.
- Locations are "suited" to the resources types
- # of locations change based on player count
- 
**** Buildings now come out on a carousel
**** 
*** Playtest notes
The tension of surviving felt about right but we need to tweak it for increased early economy to build. 

- Ramp up of zombie track being +1 vs larger gapping felt great.
